(3) 
The probability that you will win a game is 0.45. (a) If you play the game 80 times, what is the most likely number of wins? (b) What are the mean and standard deviation of a binomial distribution with Ï€ = 0.45 and N = 80? (relevant section)

(6)
You flip a coin three times. (a) What is the probability of getting heads on only one of your flips? (b) What is the probability of getting heads on at least one flip? (relevant section & relevant section)

(7) 
A test correctly identifies a disease in 95% of people who have it. It correctly identifies no disease in 94% of people who do not have it. In the population, 3% of the people have the disease. What is the probability that you have the disease if you tested positive? (relevant section)

(8)

(9)
You roll a fair die five times, and you get a 6 each time. What is the probability that you get a 6 on the next roll? (relevant section)

(10)
An unfair coin has a probability of coming up heads of 0.65. The coin is flipped 50 times. What is the probability it will come up heads 25 or fewer times? (Give answer to at least 3 decimal places). (relevant section)

(11)
You draw two cards from a deck, what is the probability that 

both of them are face cards (king, queen, or jack)?

What is the probability that you draw two cards from a deck and both of them are hearts? (relevant section)

(12)
True/False: You are more likely to get a pattern of HTHHHTHTTH than HHHHHHHHTT when you flip a coin 10 times. (relevant section)

(13)
True/False: Suppose that at your regular physical exam you test positive for a relatively rare disease. You will need to start taking medicine if you have the disease, so you ask your doctor about the accuracy of the test. It turns out that the test is 98% accurate. The probability that you have Disease X is therefore 0.98 and the probability that you do not have it is .02. (relevant section)
